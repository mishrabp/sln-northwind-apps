/**

Instructions to add swagger to .Net Core Web API Project.
https://swagger.io/
**/

1. Make sure that the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package has been installed in the Web API project.

> dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore


2. Add Swagger service in the application by writing the following code in the ConfigureServices method in startup.cs class file

services.AddSwaggerGen();  


3. In the Startup.Configure method, here we will enable the swagger middleware JSON document and the Swagger UI:

app.UseSwagger();  
app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>  
{  
   c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My Test1 Api v1");  
}); 


4. (OPTIONAL) If we want to get more configuration action passed to the AddSwaggerGen method then we need to add information 
such as the author, license, and description and in the Startup class, we need to import the following namespace:


using Microsoft.OpenApi.Models;  
services.AddSwaggerGen(c => {  
    c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo {  
        Version = "v1",  
            Title = "Test API",  
            Description = "A simple example for swagger api information",  
            TermsOfService = new Uri("https://example.com/terms"),  
            Contact = new OpenApiContact {  
                Name = "Your Name XYZ",  
                    Email = "xyz@gmail.com",  
                    Url = new Uri("https://example.com"),  
            },  
            License = new OpenApiLicense {  
                Name = "Use under OpenApiLicense",  
                    Url = new Uri("https://example.com/license"),  
            }  
    });  
});
